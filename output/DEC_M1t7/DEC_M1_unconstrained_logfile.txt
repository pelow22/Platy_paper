=============================================
Biogeographic Stochastic Mapping is finished.

Saving cladogenetic and anagenetic events tables. The commands:

...will load them to objects RES_clado_events_tables and RES_ana_events_tables.

Now returning to console 'BSM_output', which contains:

This can sometimes happen in e.g. MCC (majority clade consensus) trees output by BEAST's TreeAnnotator.
You must fix the Newick file. See ?check_BioGeoBEARS_run, and PhyloWiki, for comments. One option is to try impose_min_brlen() and then write the tree to a file.
