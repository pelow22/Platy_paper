Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=171
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ADF

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=178
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BJ

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=61
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  D 
Desired ending range:  CE

As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=186
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  F 
Desired ending range:  CD

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=132
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  CG

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  DH

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=163
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  C 
Desired ending range:  CEI

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.
