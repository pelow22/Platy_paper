Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=195
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ABC

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=45
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  F

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=185
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=136
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  CE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=136
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  CE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=62
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  CE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=177
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ACF

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=59
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL).

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=138
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=171
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ADF

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=35
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=187
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=172
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ADF

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=60
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=198
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=65
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=185
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  E 
Desired ending range:  CDE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=61
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  E 
Desired ending range:  D

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=65
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  DH

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=181
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=223
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  CE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=130
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  D

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=186
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=61
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=187
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BJ

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=61
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  D 
Desired ending range:  CE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=173
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  ADF

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=205
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=61
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  D 
Desired ending range:  CE
