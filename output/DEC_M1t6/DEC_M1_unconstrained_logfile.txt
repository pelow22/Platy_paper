Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=227
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BC

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  DH

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=43
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  D

using calc_loglike_for_optim() on initial parameter values, with printlevel=2...
if this crashes, the error messages are more helpful
than those from inside optimx().

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  DH

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=175
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=189
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  FG

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=42
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  DH

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=188
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  C 
Desired ending range:  CDE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=222
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  I 
Desired ending range:  A

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=132
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BCE

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=73
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  D

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=74
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  D

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=90
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BC

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=59
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A 
Desired ending range:  BCE 

Note: Attempted manual history sampled disallowed state 'ABCE', try #3/10000.
