Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=180
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  A

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=186
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  C 
Desired ending range:  CDE

You must fix the Newick file. See ?check_BioGeoBEARS_run, and PhyloWiki, for comments. One option is to try impose_min_brlen() and then write the tree to a file.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=180
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=196
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  E 
Desired ending range:  AD

using calc_loglike_for_optim() on initial parameter values, with printlevel=2...
if this crashes, the error messages are more helpful
than those from inside optimx().

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=180
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead.

Error in stochastic_map_branch(): Stochastic mapping failed after maxtries=40000 tries on branch below node=206
As manual_history_for_difficult_branches==TRUE, we are manually devising a history to force-fit a difficult branch (e.g. AB -> ACEDFGH)... 

NOTE: This fix will run, but will NOT work correctly for pure '+a' models (as of 2016-05-07) where d and/or e equals 0, since the manual fix forces a random series of d and e events, on the theory that the events must be super-rare since maxtries failed, so we might as well order them randomly (subject to the constraint that the range is never NULL). For +a models, try increasing maxtries instead. 
Starting range:  EF 
Desired ending range:  ACE 

Note: Attempted manual history sampled disallowed state 'ACEF', try #1/10000.

This can sometimes happen in e.g. MCC (majority clade consensus) trees output by BEAST's TreeAnnotator.
You must fix the Newick file. See ?check_BioGeoBEARS_run, and PhyloWiki, for comments. One option is to try impose_min_brlen() and then write the tree to a file.

check_BioGeoBEARS_run() says: FATAL ERROR in check_BioGeoBEARS_run(): the input tree has branchlengths <= 0, at these nodes:

 110 

...And, at these edge numbers:
