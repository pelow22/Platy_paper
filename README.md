## Bioregions and lineage dispersal modelling of the New World Monkeys

### Appendix S1. Bioregions delineated based on extant platyrrhine geographic ranges. 

We ran the Infomap Bioregions application (https://www.mapequation.org/bioregions/, August 26, 2021) with shapefile polygons of 122 extant species of platyrrhine from IUCN as geographic range (https://www.iucnredlist.org/, April 18, 2018) and with the following parameters: unit = degree, max cell size = 4°, min cell size = 1°, max cell capacity = 100, min cell capacity = 10, patch sparse grid cells = on, number of trials = 10, and number of cluster cost = 1.45. A bipartite network of 122 species was mapped to 157 grid cells.
